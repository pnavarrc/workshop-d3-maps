[Creating Interactive Maps with D3](http://pnavarrc.github.io/workshop-d3-maps/)

## Overview

One of the most interesting applications of D3 is creating interactive, map-based data visualizations. In this workshop, you’ll learn how to obtain, transform, and manipulate geographical data with D3 by creating two applications: an interactive map-based visualization and a star map.

Alongside Pablo Navarro Castillo (author of the book [Mastering D3.js](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-D3-js-Visualization-JavaScript-Developers/dp/178328627X)), you’ll learn the GeoJSON and TopoJSON formats and understand how to use geographic data to create maps. You will review the most common geographic projections and will explore how to create and style SVG maps with D3.

- Getting and transforming geographical data

This workshop is intended for beginners to D3 with basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and some programming experience (JavaScript or otherwise). Participants are required to bring a computer with a code editor installed (Sublime Text), a modern web browser (Chrome, Safari or Firefox), and (optional) a static web server.
